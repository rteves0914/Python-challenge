Financial and Voting Analysis

I am tasked with interpreting two separate pieces of information: financial analysis and voting analysis.

Both of these data files are pulled in as CSVs and interpreted using Python. I write Python script to determine the net profit for this company as well as how long the company has existed (at least on record). In addition, I write Python script to determine the winner in an election consisting of 4 candidates as well as what percentage of the vote each candidate receives.
